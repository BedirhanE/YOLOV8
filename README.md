Multi-Camera Object Detection with YOLOv8
This repository contains code for performing object detection using YOLOv8 on frames captured from multiple cameras simultaneously. The code utilizes OpenCV for camera handling and visualization, as well as the Ultralytics YOLO wrapper for object detection.

Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time object detection on frames captured from multiple cameras.
Multi-Camera Support: Supports capturing frames from two cameras simultaneously and combining them for object detection.
FPS Display: Displays the frames per second (FPS) for each camera feed on the combined frame.
Flexible: Easily customizable for different YOLO models and camera setups.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
Ultralytics YOLO wrapper
YOLOv8 model weights
